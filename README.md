## Guide
- The [Analyses](./Analyses/) folder contains data and codes needed to compute the bioinformatic analyses.

  - To inspect the codes and programs used to annotate genomes or proteomes go to the [genome annotation](./Analyses/Genome_annotation.md) section. This section details many diverse annotation steps.
  - To inspect the codes and programs used to analyze RNA-Seq data go to the [RNA-Seq](./Analyses/RNA-Seq.md) section.
  - To inspect the scripts and steps used for metagenomic data processing and visualization (Hits per Million), refer to the [metagenomic analyses](./Analyses/metagenomic_analyses.md) section.
  - This folder also includes the [Source Data](./Analyses/Source_data) needed to run analyses.
